# Distortion, Saturation, and Wave Shaping

Saturation is a type of distortion that we can emulate in the digital
domain through the application of a stateless transfer function (or shaper
function, wave shaper) to an incoming audio signal. The notion of
saturation typically comes from analog hardware, where for example, the
hardware components (i.e. tubes, valves) of various amplifiers would subtly
and gradually deform at large voltages. Therefore the types of transfer
functions we're interested in for simulating saturation are those which
approximate the identity function, `y(x) = x`, near the origin, and which
gradually and nonlinearly taper as they approach the limits of the signal
domain, i.e. `[-1.0, 1.0]` for floating point signals.

The classic choice of such a transfer function for applying saturation
in DSP is `y(x) = tanh(g * x)`, which we parameterize through choice of `g` to
amplify or drive the signal `x` into the nonlinear regions of the tanh curve.

<Example01>
```js
export function playEx01(sliderValue) {
  let vs = el.sm(el.const({key: 'ex1:mix', value: sliderValue * 4}));
  let gs = el.sm(el.const({key: 'ex1:gain', value: (1.2 - Math.sqrt(sliderValue))}));

  let dry = el.mul(vs, el.cycle(440));
  let wet = el.tanh(dry);

  core.render(
    el.mul(gs, wet),
    el.mul(gs, wet),
  )
}
```
</Example01>

Notice in the example above how near the upper limit of `g` the output
sine tone starts to resemble a square wave. A square wave is composed of a fundamental
tone plus a series of odd harmonics on top of that fundamental. A nonlinear transfer function
which is perfectly symmetric about the origin, such as `y(x) = tanh(g * x)` will
impart odd harmonics on the output signal, hence the square wave resemblance. Introducing asymmetry here,
either in the transfer function or in the input signal itself before it
visits the saturator, will start to yield even harmonics as well.

The character of a saturator is in large part due to the balance of
harmonics produced by the transfer function, so it's worth spending time
exploring various functions and means of introducing asymmetry to your
input signal. Filtering, whether before or after the saturation step, is
also integral to the process of building a nice saturation process. It's
important to understand that, because these transfer functions are
stateless, their output depends exactly on the input given, so
pre-filtering the input signal can have just as significant a role in
shaping the overall character as can post-filtering. Let's put these ideas
together into a larger, cohesive example.

<Example02>
```js
export function playEx02(sliderValue) {
  let t = el.train(0.25);
  let sl = el.sample({path: '96_Gm_MelodicSynth_01_592.wav:0'}, t);
  let sr = el.sample({path: '96_Gm_MelodicSynth_01_592.wav:1'}, t);

  let dl = el.mul(0.75, sl);
  let dr = el.mul(0.75, sr);

  let wl = el.mul(0.25, el.tanh(el.mul(10, el.lowpass(1800, 0.4, sl))));
  let wr = el.mul(0.25, el.tanh(el.mul(10, el.lowpass(1800, 0.4, sr))));

  let vs = el.sm(el.const({key: 'ex2:mix', value: sliderValue}));

  core.render(
    el.scope(el.select(vs, wl, dl)),
    el.select(vs, wr, dr),
  );
}
```
</Example02>

While saturation refers to a type or a subset of distortion, wave shaping
refers to a process or a technique for applying distortion, through the use
of a stateless transformation. All of the prior discussion on saturation
transfer functions (or shaper functions) can therefore be referred to as
wave shaping.

To elaborate further on technique then, we turn our discussion to lookup
tables, which open the door to all kinds of highly complex transfer
functions. Notice in the last example that we compute a polynomial for each
sample of the input signal. For complicated polynomials or expensive
trigonometric functions, this can become an expensive processing task.
Historically, this detail gave way to the use of lookup tables to
precompute the expensive functions for various input values so that, while
processing our audio, all we need to do is lookup the correct output value
given an input value. In modern DSP, this still holds for improving
computational efficiency, but it also allows us to push incredibly complex
functions into our distortion algorithms.

We'll wrap up our tutorial here with one final demonstration, using
Elementary's `el.table` to implement a complicated, lookup-table based wave
shaping distortion. Because `el.table` is read with a position value on the
range `[0, 1]`, we'll see that we can simply map our input signal from its
typical `[-1, 1]` range onto `[0, 1]` and fill our lookup table such that the
origin is represented in the middle of our data table. Finally, we'll pull
in our prior discussion and use some bias and filtering to define the
character of our distortion.

<Example03>
```js
export function playEx03(sliderValue) {
  let t = el.train(0.25);

  // Our left and right channel sample playback
  let sl = el.sample({path: '96_Gm_MelodicSynth_01_592.wav:0'}, t);
  let sr = el.sample({path: '96_Gm_MelodicSynth_01_592.wav:1'}, t);

  // Here we construct a piecewise waveshaper function with:
  //   f(x), x >= 0 : tanh(x)
  //   f(x), x <  0 : tanh(sinh(x)) - 0.2 * x * sin(pi * x)
  let table = (new Float32Array(513)).fill(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
    let leftX = (256 - i) / -256;
    let rightX = i / 256;

    table[257 + i] = Math.tanh(rightX);
    table[i] = Math.tanh(Math.sinh(leftX)) - 0.3 * leftX * Math.sin(Math.PI * leftX * 2);
  }

  // Update our virtual file system. Typically you would do this only once ahead of time,
  // but for the sake of our example we'll do it here
  core.updateVirtualFileSystem({
    '/waveshaper/asym1': table,
  });

  // Our pre-distortion left and right channels. We drive the dry signals so that they'll
  // hit the nonlinear parts of our curve. We pre-filter with a subtle lowpass, and we sweep
  // a slow DC offset (bias) to push the signal into different regions of the wave shaper.
  let dl = el.add(el.mul(0.1, el.cycle(1)), el.mul(10, el.smooth(0.6, sl)));
  let dr = el.add(el.mul(0.1, el.cycle(1)), el.mul(10, el.smooth(0.6, sr)));

  // Now we map our signal through the waveshaping table to derive our wet signals. We
  // use a DC blocker to remove any lingering DC component, then gain down to a reasonable
  // volume
  let wl = el.mul(0.2, el.dcblock(el.table({path: '/waveshaper/asym1'}, el.mul(0.5, el.add(1, dl)))));
  let wr = el.mul(0.2, el.dcblock(el.table({path: '/waveshaper/asym1'}, el.mul(0.5, el.add(1, dr)))));

  let vs = el.sm(el.const({key: 'ex3:mix', value: sliderValue}));

  core.render(
    el.scope(el.select(vs, wl, sl)),
    el.select(vs, wr, sr),
  );
}
```
</Example03>

At this point, hopefully you've learned enough to jumpstart your own
exploration into the broad world of saturation, wave shaping, and distortion.
The last detail to leave with, then, is a small caution that wave shaping can
have drastic and sometimes undesirable results. If the result of applying the
transformation is an output signal with discontinuities or drastically sharp
edges, you will likely encounter aliasing, which we often aim to avoid. This is
an entire topic on its own, but if you're interested you can read on in
